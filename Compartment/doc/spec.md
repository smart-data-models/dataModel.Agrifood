## List of properties  

- `additionalInfo`: list of all the raw values sent by the sensor/platform with all the possible extra properties that are not included in the main structure. It is a JSON structure similar to this: { 'temperature': '32', 'humidity':'42'}  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `arrivalTimestamp`: Date and Time at which the animal were inserted in the compartment  - `avgGrowth`: The average growth in weight of the animals in this compartment  - `avgWeight`: The average weight of the pigs in this compartment  - `buildingId`: Unique identifier of a building the compartment is located in  - `co2`: The CO2 concentration in the compartment  - `companyId`: Unique identifier of a company  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `empty`: True/False value if the compartment is empty  - `farmId`: Unique identifier of a farm where the compartment is located in  - `feedConsumption`: The total amount of food that has been eaten from the feeding station(s) in the compartment  - `humidity`: Quantity representing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere in the compartment  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `lastUpdate`: Date and time at which the measurements in the compartment were taken. Unix timestamp  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `luminosity`: The brightness of a light source of a certain wavelength at the compartment  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `numAnimals`: Number of animals in the compartment  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `parentCompartmentId`: Unique identifier of the  compartment where this compartment is a part of. It is used only when a compartment contains other compartments  - `relatedSource`: List of IDs the current entity may have in external applications  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `sex`: The sex of the animals contained in the compartment  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `temperature`: Temperature of the compartment.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. it has to be Compartment  - `waterConsumption`: The total amount of water that came out from the tap or taps in the compartment  - `weightStDev`: The standard deviation associated to the average weight of the pigs/piglets contained in the compartment
