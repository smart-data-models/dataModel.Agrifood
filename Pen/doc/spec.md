It is a JSON structure similar to this: {'name': 'temperature', 'value' : 32}  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `arrivalTimestamp`: Date and Time for the arrival of animals to the Pen  - `avgGrowth`: The average growth in weight of the animal in this pen  - `avgWeight`: The average weight of the animal in this Pen.   - `buildingId`: Unique identifier of the Building the item is located in  - `co2`: The CO2 concentration in the item  - `companyId`: Unique identifier of a company  - `compartmentId`: Unique identifier of the Compartment the Pen is located in.  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `deadAnimalsSinceDateOfArrival`: Number of dead animals since the date of arrival  - `description`: A description of this item  - `farmId`: Unique identifier of the Farm the Pen is located in.  - `feedConsumption`: The total amount of food that has been eaten from the feeding station(s) in the pen.It is measured through feed intakes and specific structure to let only one animal at a time to eat  - `humidity`: Quantity representing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere in the pen.   - `id`:   - `lastUpdate`: Date and time at which the measurements in the item were taken  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `luminosity`: The brightness of a light source of a certain wavelength at the item  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `numAnimals`: Number of animals contained in the Pen.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `relatedSource`: List of IDs the current entity may have in external applications  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `sex`: The sex of the animals contained in the pen  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `temperature`: Temperature of the Pen.  Unirs:' Celsius degree'  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. it has to be Pen  - `waterConsumption`: The total amount of water that came out from the tap or taps in the pen. It is measured through flowmeters and specific structure to let only one animal at a time drink.  - `weightStDev`: The standard deviation associated to the average weight of the animals contained in the Pen.
